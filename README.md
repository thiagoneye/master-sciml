# master-sciml

This repository contains the materials, code implementations, and literature reviews for the Directed Study course in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML), as part of the Master's program in Computer Science.

The primary goal of this course is to explore the intersection of machine learning and scientific computation, focusing on modern techniques to model, simulate, and analyze complex physical systems from data.

## Syllabus

The course is structured into several key modules, each covering a fundamental area of SciML. Each module includes theoretical concepts, a primary reading assignment, and a hands-on implementation project.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into folders, one for each module listed above. Inside each folder, you will find:

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with the code implementation for the module's project.
- `docs/`: The main research document(s) for the module.

## How to Use

To run the notebooks in this repository, it is recommended to create a dedicated Python environment.
